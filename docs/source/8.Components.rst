   <div style="margin-top: 30px;"></div>

The water level sensor transmits the sensed water level signal to the controller, and the computer in the controller compares the measured water level signal with the set signal to derive the deviation, and then issues “on” and “off” commands to the feedwater electric valve according to the nature of the deviation to ensure that the vessel reaches the set water level.

The water level sensor has twelve exposed copper traces, six for the Power traces and six for the Sensor traces, which are crossed and bridged by water when flooded. The circuit board has a power LED that lights up when the board is energized.

The combination of these traces acts like a variable resistor, changing the resistance value according to the water level. To be more precise, the more water the sensor is immersed in, the better the conductivity and the lower the resistance. Conversely, the less conductive it is, the higher the resistance. Next, the sensor will process the output signal voltage which will be sent to the microcontroller, thus helping us to determine the water level.

.. warning::

   The sensor cannot be fully submerged in water, please only leave the part where the ten traces are located in contact with water. In addition, energizing the sensor in a humid environment will speed up the corrosion of the probe and cut the life of the sensor, so we recommend that you only supply power when taking readings.

The PIR sensor detects infrared heat radiation that can be used to detect the presence of organisms that emit infrared heat radiation.

Passive infrared sensor (PIR sensor) is a common sensor that can measure infrared (IR) light emitted by objects in its field of view. Simply put, it will receive infrared radiation emitted from the body, thereby detecting the movement of people and other animals. More specifically, it tells the main control board that someone has entered your room.

Photoresistor is simply a light sensitive resistor. It is an active component that decreases resistance with respect to receiving luminosity (light) on the component’s light sensitive surface. Photoresistor’s resistance value will change in proportion to the ambient light detected. With this characteristic, we can use a Photoresistor to detect light intensity. The Photoresistor and its electronic symbol are as follows.

An infrared-receiver is a component which receives infrared signals and can independently receive infrared rays and output signals compatible with TTL level. It is similar with a normal plastic-packaged transistor in size and is suitable for all kinds of infrared remote control and infrared transmission.

Infrared, or IR, communication is a popular, low-cost, easy-to-use wireless communication technology. Infrared light has a slightly longer wavelength than visible light, so it is imperceptible to the human eye - ideal for wireless communication. A common modulation scheme for infrared communication is 38KHz modulation.

   <div style="margin-top: 30px;"></div>

Electronic buzzers, featuring a compact design, are versatile components powered by direct current (DC) and are commonly found across a variety of electronic devices. They serve as auditory indicators in applications such as computers, printers, photocopiers, security systems, electronic playthings, vehicular electronics, telephones, and timing devices, among others.

Classification of buzzers is based on their functionality, distinguishing between active and passive types.

   <div style="margin-top: 30px;"></div>

The operational distinction between active and passive buzzers is characterized by their internal circuitry and activation requirements:

- **Active Buzzers** are self-contained, featuring an integrated oscillating circuit that produces sound immediately when powered by DC. Their design eliminates the need for external signal modulation to generate audible tones.

- **Passive Buzzers** lack an internal oscillating circuit, and thus, are non-responsive to DC signals in terms of sound output. To induce sound from a passive buzzer, a specific frequency range of square wave signals, typically between 2 kHz and 5 kHz, must be supplied.

The presence of these internal oscillating circuits in active buzzers contributes to their higher cost in comparison to passive models, which require additional circuitry for sound emission.

Relay is a device which is used to provide connection between two or more points or devices in response to the input signal applied. In other words, relays provide isolation between the controller and the device as devices may work on AC as well as on DC. However, they receive signals from a microcontroller which works on DC hence requiring a relay to bridge the gap. Relay is extremely useful when you need to control a large amount of current or voltage with small electrical signal.

There are 4 parts in every relay:

**Electromagnet** - It consists of an iron core wounded by coil of
wires. When electricity is passed through, it becomes magnetic.
Therefore, it is called electromagnet.

**Armature** - The movable magnetic strip is known as armature. When
current flows through them, the coil is it energized thus producing a
magnetic field which is used to make or break the normally open (N/O) or
normally close (N/C) points. And the armature can be moved with direct
current (DC) as well as alternating current (AC).

**Spring** - When no currents flow through the coil on the
electromagnet, the spring pulls the armature away so the circuit cannot
be completed.

Set of electrical **contacts** - There are two contact points:

-  Normally open - connected when the relay is activated, and disconnected when it is inactive.

-  Normally close - not connected when the relay is activated, and connected when it is inactive.

   <div style="margin-top: 30px;"></div>

The working principle of relay is simple. When power is supplied to the relay, currents start flowing through the control coil; as a result, the electromagnet starts energizing. Then the armature is attracted to the coil, pulling down the moving contact together thus connecting with the normally open contacts. So the circuit with the load is energized. Then breaking the circuit would a similar case, as the moving contact will be pulled up to the normally closed contacts under the force of the spring. In this way, the switching on and off of the relay can control the state of a load circuit.

**This kit uses a custom relay module. Simply plug the device to be controlled directly into the XH2.54-2PIN interface and connect COM and GND with a jumper cap to achieve direct control of the device. This plug-and-play design eliminates the need for screwing in traditional wiring and is widely compatible with various common devices, such as motors.**

   <div style="margin-top: 30px;"></div>

This kit uses a high-performance offline speech recognition module. Its biggest feature is that it does not require an internet connection; all speech recognition and processing are completed locally on the chip, resulting in fast response and privacy protection.

It can communicate with main control chips such as Arduino, ESP32, and STM32, and send the recognition results as commands to achieve more complex system control.

This module works by converting sound into electrical signals using a microphone, then extracting sound features using a built-in chip to quickly match pre-set wake-up words and command words (such as turning on a water pump). Once the recognition is successful, it will immediately execute the preset action, such as directly controlling a pin to output a high level to turn on a desk lamp, or sending commands to other controllers via serial port.

A DC motor is a motor that converts DC electrical energy into mechanical energy. Because of its good speed regulation performance, it is widely used in electric drive. 

According to the excitation mode, DC motors are divided into three types:permanent magnet, separate excitation and self-excitation. 

When the DC power supply supplies power to the armature winding through the brush, the current in the same direction can flow through the N-pole lower conductor on the armature surface

According to the left-hand rule, the conductor will be subjected to counterclockwise torque; the S-pole lower part of the armature surface The conductor also flows in the same direction, and according to the left-hand rule, the conductor will also be subjected to a counterclockwise moment.

In this way, the entire armature winding, that is, the rotor, will rotate counterclockwise, and the input DC electrical energy will be converted into mechanical energy output on the rotor shaft.
