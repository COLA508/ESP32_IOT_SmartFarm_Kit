This design enhances the connection process and improves development efficiency. Furthermore, an integrated voltage regulator chip ensures stable circuit operation, and two rows of pins provide users with flexible wiring options.

Basic specifications include: 

- 13 three-pin input/output pins（for analog and digital connections）, compatible with 5V power; 
- Two four-pin digital connectors（containing two signal connections, one power connection, and one ground connection）; 
- One additional four-pin digital connector（with three signal connections and one ground connection）; 
- Two I2C connections; one serial communication port; and two 2.54mm pitch pins for easy connection of servos.

The water level sensor transmits the sensed water level signal to the controller, and the computer in the controller compares the measured water level signal with the set signal to derive the deviation, and then issues “on” and “off” commands to the feedwater electric valve according to the nature of the deviation to ensure that the vessel reaches the set water level.

The water level sensor has twelve exposed copper traces, six for the Power traces and six for the Sensor traces, which are crossed and bridged by water when flooded. The circuit board has a power LED that lights up when the board is energized.

The combination of these traces acts like a variable resistor, changing the resistance value according to the water level. To be more precise, the more water the sensor is immersed in, the better the conductivity and the lower the resistance. Conversely, the less conductive it is, the higher the resistance. Next, the sensor will process the output signal voltage which will be sent to the microcontroller, thus helping us to determine the water level.

.. warning::

   The sensor cannot be fully submerged in water, please only leave the part where the ten traces are located in contact with water. In addition, energizing the sensor in a humid environment will speed up the corrosion of the probe and cut the life of the sensor, so we recommend that you only supply power when taking readings.

The WS2812 RGB 8 LEDs Strip is composed of 8 RGB LEDs. Only one pin is required to control all the LEDs. Each RGB LED has a WS2812 chip, which can be controlled independently. It can realize 256-level brightness display and complete true color display of 16,777,216 colors. At the same time, the pixel contains an intelligent digital interface data latch signal shaping amplifier drive circuit, and a signal shaping circuit is built in to effectively ensure the color height of the pixel point light Consistent.

It is flexible, can be docked, bent, and cut at will, and the back is equipped with adhesive tape, which can be fixed on the uneven surface at will, and can be installed in a narrow space.

WS2812B is a intelligent control LED light source that the control circuit and RGB chip are integrated in a package of 5050 components. It internal include intelligent digital port data latch and signal reshaping amplification drive circuit. Also include a precision internal oscillator and a 12V voltage programmable constant current control part, effectively ensuring the pixel point light color height consistent.

The data transfer protocol use single NZR communication mode. After the pixel power-on reset, the DIN port receive data from controller, the first pixel collect initial 24bit data then sent to the internal data latch, the other data which reshaping by the internal signal reshaping amplification circuit sent to the next cascade pixel through the DO port. After transmission for each pixel, the signal to reduce 24bit. pixel adopt auto resha -ping transmit technology, making the pixel cascade number is not limited the signal transmission, only depend on the speed of signal transmission.

This pump essentially functions as a DC motor, operating at a voltage of 3V and a current of 100mA. Upon powering, the pump draws water in from the bottom of its plastic casing and expels it from the outlet pipe. It must always be kept immersed in water to function properly. Reversing the polarity won't turn it into a water intake device; it will only pump water out!

It's highly suitable for beginners to create a fountain or plant watering project using this submersible pump, as it is incredibly user-friendly!

**Features**

* **Voltage Scope**: DC 3 ~ 4.5V
* **Operating Current**: 120 ~ 180mA
* **Power**: 0.36 ~ 0.91W
* **Max Water Head**: 0.35 ~ 0.55M
* **Max Flow Rate**: 80 ~ 100 L/H
* **Continuous Working Life**: 100 hours
* **Water Fing Grade**: IP68
* **Driving Mode**: DC, Magnetic Driving
* **Material**: Engineering Plastic
* **Outlet Outside Diameter**: 7.8 mm
* **Outlet Inside Diameter**: 6.5 mm
* It is a submersible pump and should be used that way. It tends to heat too much that there's a risk of overheating if you turn it on unsubmerged.
